# My random coding adventure scripts and things

This is where you'll find somewhat descriptive folder names containing scripts of various levels of usefulness. They're mostly just things I'll make in a few hours one night when I get the urge to make something cool.

## OpenAI

This is where I mess around with the OpenAI API, I had early access to GPT-3, so that was fun to mess around with. Now I have access to Codex, which is fun in it's own way.

## SpaceXGraphing

This folder is where I take telemetry data from a community API (link in the actual folder) to graph telemetry data over time, it's pretty cool if I do say so myself.

## pingTest

In here I just have a script that pings a given IP (I think 1.1.1.1) as many times as you tell it to, then collects the data at the end, averages it, removes outliers, and provides you with a nice summary of your ping over time.

## riotAPI

I was planning to use the actual online Riot Games API but for now I've only used the local API. It extracts game data from your currently active match, and makes it easily accessible to code.
More details in the readme for that folder

## slasherBot

This one is a relic of the past, it's now been moved to [it's own Repo](https://github.com/BenjamooseCalto/SlasherBot). It's a Discord bot written in Python that I'm still actively developing. Just a personal project, but it's a lot of fun!

## Conclusion

Thanks for visiting my Coding Adventure Repo. If you were sent here from my Resume, I'd love to hear your thoughts, especially about what I can improve!

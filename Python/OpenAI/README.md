# OpenAI

This folder is actually pretty cool. Not because I've done anything particularly special, but because OpenAI is just so cool.

I got early access to GPT-3 a few months back, and was playing with it for various things. I learned that you can fine-tune a model to get it to act in the way you want it to act. I just decided for no reason in particular to teach it to pick out useful information from a string, ex. "Convert 28F to C" - it'd return "28 F C" - I could then use that to convert the temperature and return the conversion.

Obviously this is a terrible way of accomplishing that goal, but hey it was fun to figure out how to generate all that data. You can find that in [[generate_data.py]]

If you, for some reason, want to view the data it generated, that can be found in [[data.jsonl]] and the OpenAI-processed data can be found in [[data_prepared.jsonl]]

[[codex.py]] was just where I was gonna play around with codex, as I also have early access to that. Now I have Github CoPilot so I don't really use it much, but it's still awesome.

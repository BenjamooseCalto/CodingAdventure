# SpaceX Graphing

Hey! This little script takes data from the [Launch Dashboard API](https://github.com/shahar603/Launch-Dashboard-API) and graphs it in a (hopefully) easy to read way.

I excluded the data from github because it's like many hundreds of thousands of lines of telemetry data. Python does a pretty good job of handling all that information though.

# Riot Games API Test Stuff

In this file, I'm using the Riot Games API (currently only the LOCAL api) to build a model in code, of the game that is currently in progress.

I have a few ideas for what I want to use this for...

- An OBS overlay that provides cool details about the game to viewers
- Possibly the ability to feed it into machine learning models to predict your chances of winning in real-time (way above my capabilities right now, but hey it sounds cool.)
- A way to analyze how the game went after the fact, and see areas of improvement

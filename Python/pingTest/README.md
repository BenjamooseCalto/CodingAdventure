# Ping testing script thing

Personally, I have no idea why I decided to go this route when it came to testing ping.

The reason I started this at all was because there was a bigger than average solar flare coming for Earth and I wanted to see if it'd have any effect on my ping to any given place

I managed to extract the data consistently and also filter out outliers caused by me being on WiFi and not ethernet, but ultimately, this was not the correct way to go about doing this, and I never tried to collect real-world data with it.

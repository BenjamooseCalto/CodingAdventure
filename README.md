# CodingAdventure
Random coding projects I've worked on with a few larger ones mixed in.

The biggest project is slasherBot, my Discord bot made in Python. I have finally moved it to it's own repo -- It can be found [here](https://github.com/BenjamooseCalto/SlasherBot)

In the Arma folder, you'll find all the scripts I've made for my custom Arma 3 missions.

Note: The items in the Tensorflow/PyTorch folders are not made from scratch by me. Those are what I've made while learning, following guides.

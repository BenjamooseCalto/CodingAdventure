Random scripts and small coding projects and scripts I've worked on

The biggest project is slasherBot, my Discord bot made in Python. I have **finally** moved it to it's own repo -- It can be found [here](https://github.com/BenjamooseCalto/SlasherBot)

In the Arma folder, you'll find all the scripts I've made for my custom Arma 3 missions.

The Python folder contains most of my work, as well as more details.

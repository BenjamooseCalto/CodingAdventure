# CodingAdventure
Random coding projects I've worked on with a few larger ones mixed in.

The biggest project in here is slasherBot, my Discord bot made in Python. -- It can be found under in Python/slasherBot

In the Arma folder, you'll find all the scripts I've made for my custom Arma 3 missions.

Note: The items in the Tensorflow/PyTorch folders are not made from scratch by me. Those are what I've made while learning, following guides.
